Big Alien is presented as a Multi-lib Operating System built from open source software that has been compiled from scratch to provide a usable desktop environment for everyday needs.
This release is the result of my work to date in my endeavor to build a safe and secure working environment on which to developed my projects.
This live DVD provides all of the components and environment needed to compile the Alien platform.
The building process has been automated from start to finish to make compiling easier and faster.
This platform has delivered proven reliability, security and performance over the last 3 years and although incomplete and not user friendly Alien has shown its solid ability to function over extended periods of time without fault.
Released without license Alien is a working example of some of the possibilities that are achievable with open source software today and a testament to the efforts made by the free community as a whole.

Enjoy
